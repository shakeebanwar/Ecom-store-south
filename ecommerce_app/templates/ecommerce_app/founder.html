              <h2>The NileBrand</h2>
              <p>(The) Nile Brand service is focused on providing products from Africans that are 
                both based in the USA and in African countries. Their goal is not to just provide 
                products but to educate people on Africa and its history. We are coming to a critical moment as the generations grow they are likely to have less and less knowledge of their roots, where they come from and what the culture of their parents 
                and their parents meant. Education is needed and The Nile Box subscription 
                raises awareness and re-establish connection amongst some of the African diaspora.</p>
